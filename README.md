# Single_Cell_BALL_MRD
Codes and trained models for Paper 'Elucidating Minimal Residual Disease of Pediatric B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia by Single Cell Analysis'.

#### B cell differentiation stage classifier

- The B cell differentiation stage classifier  was trained by the one-class logistic regression classifier to distinguish different differentiation stages (HSC/LMPP, CLP, proB, preBI, preBII, immatureB, matureB and activatedB).

#### Non-leukemic/leukemic cell classifier

- The Non-leukemic/leukemic cell classifier was trained by a classical binary logistic regression to distinguish non-leukemic and leukemic cells in B-ALL samples.

**Notes:** Codes for the two classifiers are in the folder "Codes", and the trained models are in the folder "Data".
